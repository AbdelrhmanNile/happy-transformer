"1","i was here for a concert the other night. apparently, there's much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was, but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd. ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. $4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.\ni liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? not the best venue i've ever been to..."
"2","I agree with Stacey B. I am not cool enough for this place. I Spoke with Jay Malls briefly, and he was indeed cool ,This is one of the best R&B DJ's since Venus Flytrap. (from \""WKRP in Cincinnati\"" )\n\nI hope to stop in again soon . It is worth the trip."
"1","Fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\n\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that.  I feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  Each time I'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  I don't believe there was ever a time I could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  Give that woman a hand."
"1","I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. \n\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\n\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!"
"1","What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me."
